# Decentralized Prediction Market

## Project Description

The Decentralized Prediction Market is a blockchain-based platform that enables users to create and participate in prediction markets for future events and outcomes. Users can place bets on binary outcomes (Yes/No) for various events, from sports results to political elections, market movements, and social phenomena. The platform operates on a peer-to-peer basis, with smart contracts automatically handling bet placement, outcome resolution, and prize distribution, creating a transparent and trustless environment for predictive betting.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize information aggregation and create the world's most accurate prediction platform through collective intelligence. By harnessing the wisdom of crowds and providing economic incentives for accurate predictions, we aim to build a decentralized oracle of human knowledge that can provide valuable insights into future events. We believe that decentralized prediction markets can serve as powerful tools for risk assessment, decision-making, and social coordination.
